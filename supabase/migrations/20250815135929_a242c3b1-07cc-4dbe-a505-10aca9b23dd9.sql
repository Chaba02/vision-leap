-- Insert a test admin user for demonstration
-- Note: This creates a user that can be used with signup, not a pre-existing account
-- The actual user will be created when someone signs up with this email

-- For now, we'll just ensure the admin_users table is ready
-- The first admin can be added manually via the admin interface or SQL after signup
